  **About Me**  

  Welcome! I am Abhinandan Das, a Master's student in Data Science (Business and Management) at the University of Manchester, driven by a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. With a Global Futures Scholarship and a strong academic foundation, my expertise spans Python for Business Analytics, Text Mining, and Statistics and Machine Learning. My dissertation focuses on Sequence Mining and Aspect Detection using NLP on Airbnb reviews.  

  I bring two years of professional experience as a Business Analyst at LTIMindtree, where I worked with ABSA to deliver impactful results in financial data analysis, application support, and strategic decision-making. I excelled in designing reports and dashboards, conducting root cause analyses, and maintaining exceptional client satisfaction. My work emphasized efficiency and operational excellence, supported by tools like Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.  

  In addition, I recently completed a Data Scientist internship at ITV, where I predicted audience engagement for new series using machine learning models, achieving a top accuracy of 83%.  

  Beyond academics and work, I am passionate about solving complex problems through data storytelling and cutting-edge analytics. My technical proficiencies include Python, SQL, MongoDB, and Power BI, complemented by a strong analytical mindset, adaptability, and collaboration skills.  

  Letâ€™s connect and explore how data can drive innovation!
